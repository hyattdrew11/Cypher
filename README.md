# Cypher
Cypher is an opensource PHP admin and analytics dahsboard. It is designed to help developers quickly setup and modify the application to fit their project needs. My aim is also to help those new to PHP development and development in general circumvent many of the barriers I faced as a new developer with no formal training.

## Getting Started 

### Tools I reccomend you download for developing on your PC

* [Sublime Text | Opensource Text Editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
* [MAMP: My Apache - MySQL - PHP local server](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/)
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) My prefered browser with Developer Tools Included
* [Mozilla Firefox with Firebug Developer Tools](http://getfirebug.com/)

Google Chrome, Sublime Text, and MAMP have been invaluable tools I have used developing for various projects. MAMP provides a means to mimic the functionality of a server with PHP and MySQL installed, on your PC. Sublime Text is a powerful yet user firendly text editor, which allows you to manage and edit your developement projects. Google chrome and Mozilla Firefox are popular web browsers. I prefer Google Chrome as it comes with developer tools pre-installed. 

### Managing Your Workflow

After downloading the source files for this project I reccomend moving them to an easily accesible area on your PC. I use a Macbook Pro for development and organize all my projects in the home directory, which can be typically be found in your finder favorites between the Desktop and Applications tabs. 

Using the home directory for projects will save you some headache once you become more familiar with Git and the using the command line. Since you are here on Github I will assume you know the basics of Git, but if not here is a guide that helped me when I had no idea what Git was or was used for [Git No Deep Sh!+](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).
