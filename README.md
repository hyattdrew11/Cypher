# Cypher
Cypher is an opensource PHP admin and analytics dahsboard. It is designed to help developers quickly setup and modify the application to fit their project needs. My aim is also to help those new to PHP development and development in general circumvent many of the barriers I faced as a new developer with no formal training.
